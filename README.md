# TCGLibrary

Tcg Library is a card library for the Pok√©mon trading card game using C# and UWP.

This app is simpler, I was using this app to learn about APIs and MVVM, MVC, and using SDKs. when the user opens the application the app loads a list of the currently available sets from the API. When the user clicks on a set, it then loads all the cards in that set, which then can be clicked on for detailed viewing.
