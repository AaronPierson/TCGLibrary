# TCGLibrary

Tcg Library is a card library for the Pok√©mon trading card game using C# and UWP.

I was using this app to learn about APIs, and MVVM, and using SDKs. When the user opens the application the app loads a list of the currently available sets from the API. When the user clicks on a set, it then loads all the cards in that set, which then can be clicked on for detailed viewing.


It's currently available on the windows app store
This app is a older bulid of the current version live on the store
